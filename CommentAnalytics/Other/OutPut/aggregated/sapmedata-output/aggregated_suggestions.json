        "ABA suggests that the CFPB should limit the rule to facilitating access to consumer information, address liability concerns, remove the prohibition on fees, consider the collective impact of regulations on small banks, provide clear standards and certification processes, avoid simultaneous rulemaking activities, and offer reasonable compliance timeframes.",
        "The CFPB should exempt 'natural' third parties from developer interface requirements, remove wet signature options, provide clarity on secondary language sections, enforce explicit data deletion requirements, reduce retention periods to 24 months, clarify definitions and machine-readable data fields, limit request rights to active accounts, and offer model forms and guidance for small entities.",

        "The CFPB should consider reproposing the rule after reviewing and addressing comments received to ensure stakeholders have a meaningful opportunity to comment on proposed revisions. The final rule should explicitly prohibit screen scraping and credential-based access by all third parties and data aggregators, and the CFPB should directly supervise these entities to ensure compliance with data privacy and security requirements.",
        "The CFPB should allow data providers to obtain their own consumer authorizations, clarify liability rules, enforce minimum data security standards, permit compensation for data providers, ensure standardized data formats are adopted, and extend compliance timelines.",
        "The Clearing House Association suggests that the CFPB clarify the definition of data providers, limit data sharing to data generated directly by the entity, set explicit compliance dates for third parties, require third parties to become authorized, and provide clear guidelines on the definition of consumer and categories of covered data.",

Prohibit the use of screen scraping and impose a prohibition on third parties from collecting consumer credentials.",
        "The feedback suggests that the rule should provide a reasonable period for due diligence, establish a comprehensive liability framework, allow for broader risk management considerations, and distinguish between initial and subsequent data requests for consumer authentication.",

FDX also requests further clarification on the definition of 'Terms and Conditions' for standardized data formatting.",
        "FTA suggests allowing broader use of consumer data with appropriate safeguards, providing more clarity on the role of SSOs, and creating a realistic timeframe for implementing Section 1033 requirements.

The aggregated suggestions regarding the organization's rules and regulations primarily focus on the following key themes and topics:

1. **Extension and Flexibility in Compliance Timelines**:
   - Multiple commenters suggest extending the comment period and compliance timelines, particularly for small banks and large institutions, to ensure adequate preparation and implementation.

2. **Clarification of Roles and Definitions**:
   - There is a call for clear definitions of data providers, data aggregators, and third parties, as well as their respective roles and responsibilities. This includes clarifying liability rules and the scope of data collection and sharing.

3. **Prohibition of Screen Scraping and Credential-Based Access**:
   - A recurring suggestion is to explicitly prohibit screen scraping and credential-based access by third parties once API access is available, to enhance data security and privacy.

4. **Data Security and Privacy Standards**:
   - Commenters emphasize the need for robust data security standards, including minimum data security requirements, tokenized account numbers, and clear data deletion and retention policies. There is also a call for standardized data formats and machine-readable data fields.

5. **Supervision and Certification of Third Parties**:
   - Suggestions include creating a supervisory program for data aggregators, establishing a non-binding accreditation body for nonbanks, and requiring third parties to become authorized and certified. There is also a recommendation for direct CFPB supervision of these entities.

6. **Consumer Control and Transparency**:
   - Enhancing consumer control over their data is a key theme, with suggestions for opt-in/opt-out choices for data use, clear revocation methods, and transparency in data access and usage. There is also a call for model forms and guidance for small entities.

7. **Fee Structures and Cost Recovery**:
   - Commenters suggest allowing data providers to charge reasonable fees for data access and developer interfaces, and to recover costs and margins. There is also a recommendation to remove the prohibition on fees.

8. **Performance and Reporting Standards**:
   - Recommendations include adopting commercially reasonable performance specifications, modifying latency thresholds, and allowing industry bodies to publish performance statistics. There is also a call for clear public disclosure requirements for developer interface documentation.

9. **Regulatory Coordination and Avoidance of Duplication**:
   - Commenters urge the CFPB to coordinate with other regulatory bodies, avoid simultaneous rulemaking activities, and ensure new rules do not duplicate existing regulatory obligations.

10. **Secondary Data Use and Data Sharing Limitations**:
    - There are suggestions to allow responsible secondary use of data with appropriate safeguards, exempt de-identified data from restrictions, and establish stringent limitations on secondary data sharing.

11. **Feedback on Specific Provisions**:
    - Specific feedback includes withdrawing proposed ยง 1033.211(c), ensuring Regulation E obligations for data aggregators, supporting the use of tokenized account numbers, and recognizing industry-led standards for data sharing.

12. **Positive Feedback**:
    - Some commenters appreciate the CFPB's efforts to enhance data privacy and security, and the inclusion of consumer protection measures in the proposed rules.

Overall, the suggestions emphasize the need for clear definitions and roles, robust data security and privacy standards, consumer control and transparency, reasonable compliance timelines, and coordination with other regulatory bodies to avoid duplication and ensure effective implementation.

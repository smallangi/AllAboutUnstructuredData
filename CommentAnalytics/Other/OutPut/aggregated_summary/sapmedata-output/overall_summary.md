The feedback on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Proposed Rule on Personal Financial Data Rights, primarily from financial institutions and industry associations, highlights several key themes and concerns:

1. **General Support and Appreciation**: Many organizations, including the American Bankers Association (ABA), American Fintech Council (AFC), Bank Policy Institute, Clearing House Association, Financial Technology Association (FTA), and others, appreciate the CFPB's efforts to enhance consumer financial data rights and support the rule's intent to promote innovation, competition, and consumer protection.

2. **Concerns and Recommendations**:
   - **Scope and Definitions**: There are significant concerns about the rule's scope, definitions, and limitations on data use. Organizations like AFC and FTA suggest refining these aspects to avoid unintended consequences and ensure clarity.
   - **Liability and Compliance**: Multiple commenters, including ABA and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC), emphasize the need for clear liability frameworks and practical compliance timelines. They stress the importance of fair apportionment of liability within the financial data sharing ecosystem.
   - **Data Security and Standards**: The necessity for minimum data security standards, standardized data formats, and clear regulatory requirements is a recurring theme. Organizations advocate for industry-led standards and tokenized account numbers to enhance security.
   - **Consumer Authorization and Authentication**: There is a strong emphasis on the need for clear distinctions between identity authentication and data sharing authorization. Commenters suggest that data providers should obtain their own consumer authorizations and manage risks associated with data sharing.
   - **Prohibition on Fees**: Several organizations, including JPMC and FDATA North America, argue against the prohibition on fees for data access, citing substantial costs and the need for fair compensation for data providers.
   - **Screen Scraping**: Many commenters support prohibiting screen scraping once API access is available, highlighting the risks associated with unsafe data access practices.
   - **Implementation and Compliance Burdens**: Concerns about the technological and financial burdens on small banks and community banks are raised, with suggestions for exemptions or fee allowances to mitigate these challenges.

3. **Positive Feedback and Suggestions for Improvement**:
   - **Consumer Empowerment and Innovation**: Organizations like FTA and Plaid emphasize the importance of consumer control over financial data and the role of data access platforms in promoting competition and innovation.
   - **Standardization and Interoperability**: There is broad support for standardized data formats and interoperable standards to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing.
   - **Regulatory Clarity and Safe Harbors**: Commenters highlight the need for clear regulatory requirements, safe harbors for compliance, and practical approaches to authorization and data security.
   - **Collaboration and Supervision**: Suggestions for collaboration with other regulatory bodies and direct supervision of data access platforms are made to ensure effective implementation and enforcement.

4. **Specific Concerns and Detailed Feedback**:
   - **Data Privacy Protections**: Plaid and other organizations emphasize the importance of consistent application of privacy protections to both third parties and data providers, arguing that de-identified data should not be subject to privacy restrictions.
   - **Performance Specifications**: Concerns about the quantitative performance specifications, such as the 99.5% successful return rate, are raised, with suggestions for more practical and achievable standards.
   - **Consumer Data Rights and Revocation**: Feedback supports the proposal to allow consumers to manage their data sharing but raises concerns about potential anticompetitive behavior and consumer confusion. Recommendations include establishing guardrails and clear authorization procedures.

Overall, the feedback underscores the need for a balanced approach that ensures consumer protection, promotes innovation, and provides clear and practical regulatory requirements. The commenters advocate for refinements to the proposed rule to address their concerns and enhance its effectiveness.

        "The Bank Policy Institute and The Clearing House Association appreciate the opportunity to comment on the CFPB's Proposed Required Rulemaking on Personal Financial Data Rights. They support innovation and competition in financial services, provided it is conducted responsibly and with consumer protection. They emphasize the importance of a safe, secure, reliable, and competitive data access framework and provide several policy recommendations to enhance consumer protections, prohibit screen scraping, ensure clear regulatory requirements, and fairly apportion liability within the financial data sharing ecosystem.",
        "The feedback addresses concerns and recommendations regarding the proposed rule on consumer data sharing. Key points include the need for data providers to obtain their own consumer authorizations, the importance of clear liability frameworks, the necessity of minimum data security standards, and the ability for data providers to receive compensation for their services. The feedback also emphasizes the need for standardized data formats and appropriate compliance timelines.",
        "The Clearing House Association provides detailed feedback on the CFPB's proposed rule regarding data sharing and the definition of data providers. They emphasize the need for clarity on which entities are considered data providers, the limitations on data sharing, and the compliance dates for third parties. They also suggest amendments to definitions and compliance requirements to ensure consumer protection and effective implementation.",
        "The feedback criticizes the proposed \u00a7 1033.211(c) for failing to address consumer protection implications, payment system risks, and lacking a proper cost-benefit analysis. It suggests withdrawing the provision due to potential unintended consequences, regulatory responsibilities, and the need for clear liability and indemnification rules. The feedback also highlights the importance of distinguishing between different payment services, ensuring Regulation E obligations for data aggregators, and the risks associated with sharing consumer identity authentication information. It supports the use of tokenized account numbers and industry-led standards for data sharing.",
        "The feedback discusses various aspects of the proposed regulations under \u00a7 1033.141(a) and related sections, expressing support for certain attributes while raising concerns about practical implementation and potential conflicts with existing regulations. The feedback emphasizes the need for clarity on confidentiality, balanced decision-making, and the role of standard-setting bodies (SSBs). It also highlights the importance of regulatory safe harbors, the need for standardized data formats, and the potential issues with screen scraping and compensation for data providers.",
        "The feedback broadly supports the requirement for developer interfaces to make covered data available in a standardized format and the safe harbor provisions for compliance. However, it raises concerns about the quantitative performance specifications, particularly the 99.5% successful return rate, and suggests that a 'commercially reasonable' standard would be more appropriate. The feedback also opposes the use of QIS for performance specifications and suggests removing certain duplicative or overly broad requirements. Additionally, it recommends prohibiting screen scraping and imposing a prohibition on third parties from collecting consumer credentials.",
        "The feedback discusses the proposal's provisions regarding data providers' ability to deny access based on risk management concerns, the need for a reasonable period for due diligence, and the importance of a comprehensive liability framework. It also emphasizes the necessity for data providers to manage various risks, not just data security, and suggests that the rule should allow for broader risk management considerations. Additionally, the feedback addresses the need for proper consumer authentication and the distinction between initial and subsequent data requests.",
        "The feedback emphasizes the need for clear distinctions between identity authentication and data sharing authorization, highlighting that consumers should provide separate authorizations to data providers and third parties. It critiques the proposed rule for not adequately recognizing these distinctions and suggests that data providers should be allowed to receive their own consumer authorization for new data sharing requests. The feedback also addresses concerns about liability, the need for explicit provisions regarding unauthorized third parties, and the importance of clear revocation methods. Additionally, it discusses the burdensome nature of certain documentation and reporting requirements, suggesting more practical alternatives.",
        "The feedback addresses concerns about the proposed \u00a7 1033.351(b)(1) and other related sections, highlighting the significant compliance burden and lack of consumer benefit. It argues that the requirements for data providers to maintain extensive records and databases are overly burdensome and unnecessary, given existing regulatory obligations. The feedback also suggests that the proposed rules could lead to increased costs without improving data sharing practices or consumer protection.",
        "The feedback provides detailed comments on the proposed rule \u00a7 1033.421 regarding the collection, use, and retention of covered data by third parties. It highlights concerns about the adequacy of the proposal in protecting consumer data, the need for more stringent standards for secondary data sharing, and the necessity for direct supervision and enforcement by the CFPB. The feedback also suggests improvements in data security standards, transparency, and consumer control over data sharing."

        "The CFPB should consider reproposing the rule after reviewing and addressing comments received to ensure stakeholders have a meaningful opportunity to comment on proposed revisions. The final rule should explicitly prohibit screen scraping and credential-based access by all third parties and data aggregators, and the CFPB should directly supervise these entities to ensure compliance with data privacy and security requirements.",
        "The CFPB should allow data providers to obtain their own consumer authorizations, clarify liability rules, enforce minimum data security standards, permit compensation for data providers, ensure standardized data formats are adopted, and extend compliance timelines.",
        "The Clearing House Association suggests that the CFPB clarify the definition of data providers, limit data sharing to data generated directly by the entity, set explicit compliance dates for third parties, require third parties to become authorized, and provide clear guidelines on the definition of consumer and categories of covered data.",
        "Withdraw proposed \u00a7 1033.211(c). Ensure Regulation E obligations for data aggregators and third parties. Create clear liability and indemnification rules. Support the use of tokenized account numbers. Recognize and support industry-led standards for data sharing.",
        "The feedback suggests that the CFPB should clarify confidentiality requirements, consider the totality of SSB governance for balanced decision-making, impose obligations on data aggregators for standardized data formats, explicitly prohibit screen scraping, and allow data providers to recover costs and a margin for developer interfaces.",
        "Adopt a 'commercially reasonable' standard for performance specifications instead of the 99.5% successful return rate. Remove references to QIS for performance specifications. Prohibit the use of screen scraping and impose a prohibition on third parties from collecting consumer credentials.",
        "The feedback suggests that the rule should provide a reasonable period for due diligence, establish a comprehensive liability framework, allow for broader risk management considerations, and distinguish between initial and subsequent data requests for consumer authentication.",
        "The feedback suggests allowing data providers to receive their own consumer authorization for new data sharing requests, changes to existing authorizations, and in response to risk management concerns. It also recommends absolving data providers from liability if they comply with third-party requests, providing more granular control over revocation methods, and adopting more practical documentation and reporting requirements, such as quarterly reporting and allowing industry bodies to publish performance statistics.",
        "The feedback suggests removing the requirement for data providers to maintain extensive records and databases, clarifying the authorization procedures for third parties, and ensuring that any new rules do not duplicate existing regulatory obligations.",
        "The feedback suggests establishing more stringent limitations on secondary data sharing, requiring direct CFPB supervision of third parties and data aggregators, ensuring greater transparency and control for consumers over their data, and mandating data aggregators to provide data in a standardized format."

        "The Financial Technology Association (FTA) provides feedback on the Bureau's Proposal regarding the prohibition of 'secondary use' of financial data. FTA argues that the proposal is overly broad and suggests more tailored safeguards to avoid unintended consequences. They emphasize the consumer benefits of secondary data use, such as personalized financial advice and tailored product recommendations. FTA also highlights the importance of allowing the use of de-identified data for research and development, and the need for a recognized standards setting organization (SSO) to ensure the safe and efficient operation of an open banking regime. Additionally, FTA calls for realistic implementation timeframes and greater clarity regarding digital wallet providers and their responsibilities."

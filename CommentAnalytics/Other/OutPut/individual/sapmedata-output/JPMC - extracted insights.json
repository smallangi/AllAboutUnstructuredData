        "JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC) appreciates the CFPB's proposed rule on Personal Financial Data Rights, emphasizing the importance of safe, permissioned access to financial data. JPMC highlights the risks of unsafe data access practices like screen scraping and suggests prohibiting such practices once API access is available. They also argue against the prohibition on fees for data access, citing substantial costs and the need for fair compensation. Additionally, JPMC raises concerns about the CFPB's mandate to share payment initiation information, suggesting it exceeds the agency's statutory authority and poses significant risks.",

They argue that data providers should not be burdened with enforcing third-party compliance and highlight the practical and constitutional challenges of such delegation. JPMC suggests specific regulatory obligations for third parties and data aggregators, including regular examinations and enforcement. They also discuss the role of industry standards bodies and the need for balanced governance and effective risk management.",

They emphasize the importance of consumer control over financial data and the role of data access platforms in promoting competition and innovation in financial services. Plaid provides several recommendations to refine the proposed rule to better achieve its goals and avoid unintended consequences.",
        "Plaid provides detailed feedback on the Bureau's final rule, focusing on the definition of 'consumer,' the role and obligations of developer interface service providers, the transition from screen scraping to developer interfaces, and the scope of consumer data rights.",
        "Plaid provides detailed feedback on the Bureau's approach to handling sensitive consumer data, promoting pay-by-bank functionality, and the use of tokenized account numbers (TANs). They emphasize the importance of making Social Security and driver's license numbers optional but available without charge, and advocate for the reinforcement of pro-consumer and pro-competition payment developments. Plaid also discusses the benefits and risks associated with TANs, suggesting several modifications to the final rule to ensure their effective implementation. Additionally, they highlight the need for a third-party certification standard to prevent pretextual denials of access by data providers and ensure fair competition in the data access market.",
        "Plaid provides detailed feedback on the proposed rule regarding data providers' discretion to deny access to consumer data. They argue that the rule, as currently written, allows data providers too much discretion, which could be abused to stifle competition and harm consumers. Plaid suggests several clarifications and additional requirements to ensure that data providers cannot unjustly deny access to third parties authorized by consumers.",

The feedback emphasizes the need for streamlined authentication processes, industry-leading authentication methods, and the implementation of app-to-app redirects for mobile devices. Plaid also suggests that data providers should only authenticate consumers the first time they share data with a third party and not require re-authentication for subsequent authorizations.",
        "The feedback supports the CFPB's proposal to allow consumers to manage their data sharing but raises concerns about potential anticompetitive behavior and consumer confusion. It suggests establishing guardrails to ensure data providers' engagement in revocation is solely for consumer benefit. The feedback also recommends limiting data providers' communications about revocation, prohibiting reauthorization functionality at data providers, and ensuring timely communication between data providers, third parties, and data access platforms. Additionally, it proposes a dormancy test for reauthorization and emphasizes the importance of clear authorization procedures to prevent unnecessary friction and anticompetitive interference.",

They argue that de-identified data should not be subject to privacy restrictions and highlight the risks of uneven application of privacy protections, including consumer confusion and unfair competition. Plaid suggests several alternative approaches to ensure consistent data privacy protections across the open finance ecosystem.",

        "Plaid suggests adjusting implementation timeframes, refining authentication and authorization standards, revising data privacy protections, certifying third parties for access, and clarifying enforcement priorities.",
        "Plaid suggests reverting to the statutory definition of 'consumer,' adding 'developer interface service provider' as a defined term, providing additional flexibility for compliance timelines, and expanding the scope of covered data to include more account types and data elements.",
        "Plaid suggests making Social Security and driver's license numbers available without charge, reinforcing pay-by-bank functionality, modifying the final rule to ensure effective implementation of TANs, and adopting a third-party certification standard to prevent pretextual denials of access.",
        "Plaid suggests clarifying the rule to limit data providers' discretion to deny access, explicitly defining 'specific risk' as known security risks, requiring data providers to grant access once a remediation plan is established, 'legacying in' third parties with existing access, increasing transparency and reporting of access denials, strengthening the non-discrimination standard, and maintaining the prohibition on fees for interface development, maintenance, and access.",
        "Clarify that access caps impede consumers' ability to access their data.",
        "Specify that consumer-present access requests can never be capped.",
        "Prohibit restrictions on the total amount of data that a third party can request over time.",
        "Prevent smaller data providers from implementing access caps based on their size.",
        "Require data providers to include access cap and performance information in monthly reports.",
        "State that anti-competitive denials of access are violations of the law.",
        "Provide mechanisms for reporting noncompliance and review complaints for enforcement.",
        "Plaid suggests that the Bureau should require data providers to conduct authentication on a single screen, use industry-leading authentication methods, implement app-to-app redirects for mobile devices, and only authenticate consumers the first time they share data with a third party. Additionally, Plaid recommends clarifications to the authorization procedures to enhance consumer protection and reduce friction.",
        "Establish guardrails for data providers' engagement in revocation, limit data providers' communications about revocation, prohibit reauthorization functionality at data providers, ensure timely communication between data providers, third parties, and data access platforms, adopt a dormancy test for reauthorization, and specify performance requirements for data providers' developer interfaces.",
        "PLAID recommends clarifying the 'reasonably necessary' standard, removing the blanket ban on secondary data use in favor of an opt-in/opt-out structure, and ensuring privacy protections apply equally to data held by both data providers and third parties.",
        "Plaid suggests encouraging Congress to amend GLBA, undertaking a GLBA rulemaking, issuing broader guidance on data privacy, applying privacy restrictions uniformly to all ecosystem participants, explicitly stating that data access agreements are not required as a condition of access, including EBT data in the final rule, and ensuring 'account statements' are included as an enumerated data type.",
        "Adjust implementation timeframes, refine authentication and authorization standards, revise data privacy protections, clarify interface access approaches, and emphasize the Bureau's enforcement interests."

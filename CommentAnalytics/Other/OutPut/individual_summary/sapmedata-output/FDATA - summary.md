**Identified Themes:**
- **Support for Personal Financial Data Rights**: FDATA North America supports the CFPB's initiative, emphasizing the benefits of legally binding consumer financial data rights for competition, innovation, and consumer protection.
- **Need for Standardization**: The feedback stresses the importance of a standardized framework to ensure consistent and clear requirements for data access, preventing disparate approaches by financial institutions.
- **Inclusion of Additional Accounts**: The organization urges the inclusion of a broader range of accounts, such as public benefits, small business, investment, retirement, mortgages, and auto loans, to ensure comprehensive consumer data rights.
- **Amendments to the Proposed Rule**: Several suggested amendments are provided, including clarifications on data usage, reauthorization processes, data retention, and the role of intermediaries.
- **Scope of Accounts Covered**: FDATA North America recommends expanding the scope to include EBT data, auto loans, mortgage loans, student loans, and investment accounts.
- **Secondary Data Use Restrictions**: Concerns are raised about the proposed limitations on secondary data use, recommending exemptions for de-identified data and allowing compatible secondary uses by default.
- **Technological and Competitive Implications**: The need for reliable data provider interfaces, prohibition of fees for data access, and fallback methods for data access are highlighted.
- **Supervision of Data Access Platforms**: The organization encourages direct supervision of consumer-permissioned data access platforms to ensure consistent application of data privacy, security, and risk management requirements.
- **Collaboration with Regulatory Bodies**: FDATA North America urges collaboration with the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve to align TPRM requirements with Section 1033 rulemaking.

- **Legacy Technologies**: Suggestion to allow the use of legacy technologies to access data with consumer permission when developer interfaces are not feasible.
- **FCRA Requirements**: Advice to exclude consumer-permissioned data access platforms from being required to assert themselves as credit reporting agencies under FCRA.

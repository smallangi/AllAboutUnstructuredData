**Overall Summary:**
The Financial Technology Association (FTA) generally supports the CFPB's proposed rulemaking on personal financial data rights, emphasizing the importance of consumer empowerment, competition, and innovation in financial services. They provide detailed feedback and recommendations to ensure the final rule fosters consumer-centric financial services, avoids anti-competitive behavior, and leverages existing legal frameworks and technologies. However, FTA expresses concerns about the overly broad prohibition on the secondary use of financial data and calls for more tailored safeguards.

**Identified Themes:**
- **Consumer Empowerment and Innovation**: FTA believes that robust personal financial data rights can empower consumers, drive financial health, and enhance competition. They highlight the role of fintech in providing tailored financial products and services, improving transparency, and increasing financial inclusion.
- **Anti-Competitive Behavior**: FTA urges the CFPB to prevent traditional financial institutions from restricting consumer data access, which can hinder competition. They recommend monitoring and preventing industry attempts to block data sharing and promote anti-competitive objectives.
- **Leveraging Existing Frameworks**: FTA supports the reliance on existing legal and regulatory frameworks to avoid creating new, untested requirements. They emphasize the importance of standards setting organizations (SSOs) and call for more clarity and time for their proper development.
- **Broader Use of Data**: FTA advocates for the broader use of consumer data, including secondary use and de-identified data, with appropriate disclosures and safeguards. They argue that overly restrictive regulations on data use can hinder innovation and competition.
- **Secondary Use of Financial Data**: FTA argues that the prohibition on secondary use of financial data is too broad and suggests that tailored safeguards, such as clear disclosures and informed consent, would better serve regulatory objectives and consumer interests.
- **De-identified Data**: FTA emphasizes the importance of allowing the use of de-identified data for research and development, arguing that a blanket prohibition would harm industry innovation and U.S. competitiveness.
- **Standards Setting Organization (SSO)**: FTA supports the creation of an SSO to issue qualified industry standards and calls for greater clarity regarding its composition, operations, and role. They also recommend a phased approach to SSO recognition and appropriate timeframes for its development.
- **Implementation Timeframes**: FTA urges the Bureau to ensure realistic implementation timeframes to avoid confusion, security risks, and service interruptions. They suggest adding an additional 6 months to the proposed timeframes and linking them to the formal recognition of an SSO.
- **Digital Wallet Providers**: FTA calls for greater clarity regarding the definition and responsibilities of digital wallet providers, arguing that their inclusion in the Proposal may create confusion and data integrity challenges.
- **Additional Amendments and Clarifications**: FTA suggests several additional amendments and clarifications, including the interplay of Section 1033 with FCRA rulemaking, avoiding overly prescriptive disclosure requirements, and establishing clear standards around the use of Tokenized Account Numbers (TANs).

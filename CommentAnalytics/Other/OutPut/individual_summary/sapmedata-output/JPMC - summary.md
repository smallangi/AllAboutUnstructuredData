**Overall Summary:**
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC) has provided extensive feedback on the CFPB's proposed rule on Personal Financial Data Rights. The general sentiment of the feedback is mixed, with concerns about certain aspects of the rule and support for others. JPMC emphasizes the importance of safe and permissioned access to financial data, the need for direct regulation and oversight of third parties and data aggregators, and the necessity of practical and achievable standards. They also highlight operational challenges and suggest modifications to ensure the rules are feasible and beneficial for consumers.

**Identified Themes:**
- **Screen Scraping**: JPMC argues that screen scraping is a dangerous practice that should be prohibited once API access is available, highlighting the associated risks and costs.
- **Prohibition on Fees**: JPMC opposes the prohibition on fees for data access, citing substantial costs and the need for fair compensation to ensure continued investment in data security and innovation.
- **Payment Initiation Information**: JPMC raises concerns about the CFPB's mandate to share payment initiation information, suggesting it exceeds the agency's statutory authority and poses significant risks.
- **Regulation and Oversight**: JPMC stresses the need for the CFPB to directly regulate and oversee third parties and data aggregators to mitigate risks, arguing that data providers should not be responsible for enforcing third-party compliance.
- **Risk Management**: JPMC highlights the importance of allowing data providers to conduct comprehensive risk management programs and manage various risks, not just data security.
- **Industry Standards**: JPMC supports the role of industry standards bodies in promoting interoperability but cautions against giving them too much discretion.
- **Data Aggregators**: JPMC underscores the critical role of data aggregators and calls for clear regulatory obligations and oversight for these entities.
- **Consumer Authentication and Authorization**: JPMC emphasizes the need for data providers to authenticate consumers and capture authorization directly to ensure security and control over sensitive financial data.
- **Scope of Data Sharing**: JPMC suggests narrowing the scope of data sharing requirements to avoid operational burdens and protect consumer interests.
- **Prohibition of Secondary Data Use**: JPMC supports prohibiting the sale of data and limiting secondary uses to protect consumer privacy and trust.
- **Implementation Timeline**: JPMC recommends extending the compliance timeline for large institutions to at least 24 months to ensure a safe and effective implementation of the new rules.
- **Compliance Timeline and Industry Standards**: JPMC argues that the six-month compliance timeline is unrealistic and suggests allowing more time for industry standards to be established.
- **Third Party Readiness**: JPMC highlights the need for data recipients and data aggregators to have sufficient time to adapt to new rules to avoid disruption.
- **Clarity on Roles and Responsibilities**: JPMC requests clear definitions and obligations for data providers, data aggregators, and third parties.
- **Tokenized Account Numbers**: JPMC advocates for the use of tokenized account numbers to enhance security and consumer control.
- **Machine-Readable Files**: JPMC seeks clarification on the requirement for machine-readable files, expressing concerns about the potential costs and feasibility.
- **Performance Specifications**: JPMC suggests modifying response time requirements and latency thresholds to be more practical.
- **Access Cap Prohibition**: JPMC argues against involving an SSO in setting access frequency standards and supports a reasonableness standard.
- **Security Specifications**: JPMC supports the prohibition of tokenized screen-scraping and emphasizes the risks associated with screen-scraping.
- **Revocation of Third-Party Access**: JPMC recommends allowing consumers to partially revoke third-party access to specific accounts.
- **Developer Interface Documentation**: JPMC suggests modifying public disclosure requirements for developer interface documentation to ensure security and practicality.
- **Performance Reporting**: JPMC requests more time for data providers to publish performance statistics and suggests allowing an industry body to collect and publish this information.
- **Operational Challenges**: JPMC finds certain obligations problematic to operationalize and suggests removing them.
- **Denials of Information Requests**: JPMC argues that the requirement to notify consumers of denied information requests is not feasible and should be removed.
- **Record Retention**: JPMC requests clarification on the record retention requirement, expressing concerns about the significant burden it could impose.
- **Authorization Disclosure**: JPMC suggests that authorization disclosures be separate from general terms and conditions and presented at the time of the data sharing request.
- **Reauthorization**: JPMC agrees with the requirement for annual reauthorization but suggests it should be a 'lightweight' process.
- **Data Security**: JPMC recommends that all third parties comply with the FFIEC Security Handbook for data security.
- **Provision of Data to Third Parties**: JPMC seeks clarification on the circumstances under which an authorized third party can provide data to another third party.
- **Authorization Procedures**: JPMC suggests that the CFPB clearly delineate which authorization procedures must be performed by the third party and which can be handled by data aggregators.
- **Data Aggregator's Role**: JPMC recommends distinguishing between the roles of data aggregators when acting as intermediaries versus authorized third parties.
- **Consumer Control and Transparency**: JPMC highlights the need for consumers to have clear means to cease data access and for data aggregators to react promptly to revocation requests.
- **Data Aggregator Certification**: JPMC recommends modifications to the certification requirements for data aggregators, including limitations on data collection, use, and retention.

**Key Suggestions:**
- Prohibit credential-based access and screen scraping by third parties once API access is available.
- Allow data providers to charge reasonable fees for enabling data access.
- Reconsider the mandate to share payment initiation information and coordinate with prudential regulators.
- Place regulatory obligations directly on third parties and data aggregators, ensure adherence through regular examinations and enforcement, and establish a level playing field for information security requirements.
- Modify the scope of data sharing requirements, explicitly prohibit the sale of data, and extend the compliance timeline for large institutions to at least 24 months.
- Provide clear definitions and obligations for all parties involved, allow the use of tokenized account numbers, and clarify the requirements for machine-readable files.
- Modify response time requirements to an average latency threshold and set less stringent latency thresholds for customer-not-present data refreshes.
- Allow consumers to partially revoke third-party access to specific accounts and modify public disclosure requirements for developer interface documentation.
- Provide more time for data providers to publish performance statistics and allow an industry body to collect and publish performance information.
- Remove certain obligations, clarify record retention requirements, make authorization disclosures separate from general terms and conditions, and ensure data protection when providing data to other third parties.
- Clarify the responsibilities of third parties and data aggregators, prohibit data aggregators from using consumer data for unrelated purposes without explicit consent, and modify certification requirements for data aggregators.

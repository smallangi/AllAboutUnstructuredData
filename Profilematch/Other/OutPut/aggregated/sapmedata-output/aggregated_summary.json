The ABA appreciates the effort but highlights several concerns and recommendations to improve the rule's effectiveness and compliance.",
        "The American Bankers Association (ABA) provides extensive feedback on the CFPB's proposed rule under Section 1033, emphasizing the need for strict construction of the rule to focus on facilitating access to consumer information rather than enabling transactions. ABA raises concerns about liability, the prohibition on fees, competitive impacts on small banks, and the need for clear standards and certification processes. They also highlight the potential negative consequences of simultaneous rulemaking activities and the need for clarity on data provider obligations and compliance timeframes.",
        "The American Bankers Association (ABA) provides several recommendations for the CFPB regarding the implementation of Section 1033. These include exemptions for 'natural' third parties, removal of wet signature options, clarity on secondary language sections, explicit data deletion requirements, practical retention obligations, revisiting definitions, and clarifications on request rights and account statuses. ABA appreciates the CFPB's efforts but emphasizes the need for prudent and thorough regulation.",
        "The American Fintech Council (AFC) supports the CFPB's Proposed Rulemaking on Personal Financial Data Rights but has significant concerns regarding its scope, definitions, limitations on data use, and reauthorization requirements. AFC provides several recommendations to improve clarity, efficacy, and balance between consumer protection and innovation.",
        "The Bank Policy Institute and The Clearing House Association appreciate the opportunity to comment on the CFPB's Proposed Required Rulemaking on Personal Financial Data Rights. They support innovation and competition in financial services, provided it is conducted responsibly and with consumer protection. They emphasize the importance of a safe, secure, reliable, and competitive data access framework and provide several policy recommendations to enhance consumer protections, prohibit screen scraping, ensure clear regulatory requirements, and fairly apportion liability within the financial data sharing ecosystem.",
        "The feedback addresses concerns and recommendations regarding the proposed rule on consumer data sharing. Key points include the need for data providers to obtain their own consumer authorizations, the importance of clear liability frameworks, the necessity of minimum data security standards, and the ability for data providers to receive compensation for their services. The feedback also emphasizes the need for standardized data formats and appropriate compliance timelines.",
        "The Clearing House Association provides detailed feedback on the CFPB's proposed rule regarding data sharing and the definition of data providers. They emphasize the need for clarity on which entities are considered data providers, the limitations on data sharing, and the compliance dates for third parties. They also suggest amendments to definitions and compliance requirements to ensure consumer protection and effective implementation.",
        "The feedback criticizes the proposed \u00a7 1033.211(c) for failing to address consumer protection implications, payment system risks, and lacking a proper cost-benefit analysis. It suggests withdrawing the provision due to potential unintended consequences, regulatory responsibilities, and the need for clear liability and indemnification rules. The feedback also highlights the importance of distinguishing between different payment services, ensuring Regulation E obligations for data aggregators, and the risks associated with sharing consumer identity authentication information. It supports the use of tokenized account numbers and industry-led standards for data sharing.",
        "The feedback discusses various aspects of the proposed regulations under \u00a7 1033.141(a) and related sections, expressing support for certain attributes while raising concerns about practical implementation and potential conflicts with existing regulations.

Additionally, the feedback addresses the need for proper consumer authentication and the distinction between initial and subsequent data requests.",
        "The feedback emphasizes the need for clear distinctions between identity authentication and data sharing authorization, highlighting that consumers should provide separate authorizations to data providers and third parties. It critiques the proposed rule for not adequately recognizing these distinctions and suggests that data providers should be allowed to receive their own consumer authorization for new data sharing requests. The feedback also addresses concerns about liability, the need for explicit provisions regarding unauthorized third parties, and the importance of clear revocation methods. Additionally, it discusses the burdensome nature of certain documentation and reporting requirements, suggesting more practical alternatives.",
        "The feedback addresses concerns about the proposed \u00a7 1033.351(b)(1) and other related sections, highlighting the significant compliance burden and lack of consumer benefit. It argues that the requirements for data providers to maintain extensive records and databases are overly burdensome and unnecessary, given existing regulatory obligations. The feedback also suggests that the proposed rules could lead to increased costs without improving data sharing practices or consumer protection.",
        "The feedback provides detailed comments on the proposed rule \u00a7 1033.421 regarding the collection, use, and retention of covered data by third parties. It highlights concerns about the adequacy of the proposal in protecting consumer data, the need for more stringent standards for secondary data sharing, and the necessity for direct supervision and enforcement by the CFPB.

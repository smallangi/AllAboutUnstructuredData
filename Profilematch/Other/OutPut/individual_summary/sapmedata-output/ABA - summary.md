**Overall Summary:**
The American Bankers Association (ABA) has provided detailed feedback on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Proposed Rule on Personal Financial Data Rights under Section 1033. While the ABA appreciates the CFPB's efforts, it has raised several concerns and recommendations to improve the rule's effectiveness and compliance. The feedback highlights issues related to the complexity of the rule, the short comment period, liability concerns, the prohibition on fees, and the potential negative impacts on small banks. The ABA also emphasizes the need for clear standards, certification processes, and reasonable compliance timeframes.

**Identified Themes:**
- **Complexity and Comment Period**: The ABA criticizes the short comment period, suggesting it did not allow adequate time for stakeholders to assess the new regulatory framework and recommends extending the deadline for comments.
- **Consumer Data Access and Security**: The ABA supports secure and transparent consumer access to financial information but stresses that all participants in the data-sharing ecosystem should adhere to high standards similar to banks.
- **Prohibition on Fees**: The ABA opposes the prohibition on data providers assessing fees, arguing it is not supported by law and should be reconsidered.
- **Data Fields and Legal Authority**: The ABA contends that certain data fields in the NPRM exceed statutory authority, such as 'authorized but not yet settled' transactions and 'upcoming bill information.'
- **Role of Data Providers and Aggregators**: The ABA urges the CFPB to clarify that data providers are not responsible for ensuring third parties' compliance and to prohibit screen scraping. They also call for a supervisory program for data aggregators.
- **Risk Management and Fraud Prevention**: The ABA stresses the importance of risk management and fraud prevention, advocating for flexibility for data providers to manage risks and prevent fraud.
- **Accreditation and Compliance**: The ABA suggests creating a non-binding accreditation body for nonbanks to meet minimum standards, which could expedite the due diligence process for data providers.
- **Strict Construction of Section 1033**: The ABA argues that the CFPB should limit the rule to facilitating access to consumer information and not extend it to enable transactions, citing legal and policy reasons.
- **Liability Concerns**: The ABA expresses concerns about the insufficient addressing of liability in the NPRM, particularly regarding payment initiation, and suggests that liability should flow with the data.
- **Competitive Impacts on Small Banks**: The ABA highlights the potential negative impacts on small banks and urges the CFPB to consider the collective impact of multiple regulations and allow cost recoupment.
- **Standards and Certification**: The ABA calls for clear standards and certification processes for qualified industry standards (QIS) to ensure practical operationalization and compliance.
- **Simultaneous Rulemaking Activities**: The ABA cautions against conducting simultaneous rulemaking activities on foundational matters, which could lead to unintended consequences.
- **Data Provider Obligations and Compliance Timeframes**: The ABA requests clarity on data provider obligations, compliance timeframes, and the need for reasonable deadlines to ensure successful implementation.
- **Exemptions for 'Natural' Third Parties**: The ABA recommends that 'natural' third parties, such as agents and attorneys, should be exempt from the developer interface requirements under Section 1033.
- **Electronic and Wet Signatures**: The ABA suggests that the final rule should align with ESIGN and remove the option for wet signatures to ensure consistency with electronic data access.
- **Secondary Language Section Clarity**: The ABA members seek additional clarity on how UDAAP will apply to the provision of financial products and services, particularly regarding the secondary language section in authorization disclosures.
- **Data Deletion Requirements**: The ABA believes that third parties should have explicit requirements to delete data once authorization lapses or is revoked, and consumers should be able to close accounts and have data deleted upon request.
- **Retention Obligations**: The ABA finds the retention provisions in the NPRM to be overly formalized and onerous, suggesting a reduction in the retention period to no more than 24 months and clearer guidelines on what information needs to be retained.
- **Definitions and Machine-Readable Data**: The ABA recommends revisiting the definitions section to make them less circular and adding a definition for 'machine-readable' to limit the scope of data fields subject to format requests.
- **Request Rights and Account Status**: The ABA suggests that the right to make requests under Section 1033 should apply only to active accounts and that only accountholders or their representatives should be permitted to authorize requests.
- **Support for Small Entities**: The ABA urges the CFPB to provide model forms, compliance guidance, and other materials to help small entities understand Section 1033 concepts and obligations.

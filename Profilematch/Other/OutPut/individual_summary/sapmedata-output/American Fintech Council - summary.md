**Overall Summary:**
The American Fintech Council (AFC) generally supports the CFPB's Proposed Rulemaking on Personal Financial Data Rights but has expressed significant concerns regarding its scope, definitions, limitations on data use, and reauthorization requirements. AFC has provided several recommendations aimed at improving the clarity, efficacy, and balance between consumer protection and innovation.

**Identified Themes:**
- **Scope and Definitions**: AFC recommends expanding the scope of the Proposed Rulemaking to include additional types of consumer data such as EBT, securities, and payroll data. They also suggest clarifying the definition of 'Data Provider' to prevent confusion and overlap with 'third party' definitions.
- **Responsible Secondary Use of Data**: AFC is concerned that the limitations on the use of consumer data for legitimate business purposes could hinder innovation and competition. They advocate for allowing responsible secondary use of data and providing consumers with opt-in choices for targeted advertising and cross-selling.
- **Standard Setting Bodies**: AFC supports the creation of standard setting bodies but stresses the importance of ensuring that small and innovative entities can engage effectively. They recommend leveraging the CFPB's Office of Competition and Innovation to promote an equitable open banking ecosystem.
- **Reauthorization Requirements**: AFC suggests that the 12-month mandatory reauthorization window should consider any instance of data refresh as a new authorization. They also recommend exemptions for services that solely benefit consumers to avoid unnecessary frictions.

**Key Suggestions:**
- Broaden the scope of the Proposed Rulemaking to include additional consumer data types.
- Clarify the definitions, particularly 'Data Provider' to avoid confusion.
- Allow responsible secondary use of data and provide opt-in choices for targeted advertising and cross-selling.
- Leverage the CFPB's Office of Competition and Innovation to ensure equitable engagement for small and innovative entities.
- Include data refreshes as new authorizations within the 12-month reauthorization requirement and provide exemptions for consumer-benefiting services.

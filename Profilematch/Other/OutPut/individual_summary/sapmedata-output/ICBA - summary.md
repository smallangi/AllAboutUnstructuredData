**Overall Summary:**
The Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) provided feedback on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) proposed rule implementing Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The feedback highlights significant concerns about the technological and financial burdens on community banks, consumer privacy risks, and the challenges in vetting third-party data recipients. While the ICBA supports several proposed provisions, they suggest further clarifications, exemptions, and supervisory roles for the Bureau to ensure compliance and data security. The overall sentiment of the feedback is predominantly negative, with specific aspects receiving neutral or positive responses.

**Identified Themes:**
- **Technological and Financial Burdens**: The proposed rule imposes significant technological and financial burdens on community banks, particularly in establishing and maintaining developer portals without a cost-recovery mechanism.
- **Consumer Privacy Risks**: Concerns are raised about the difficulty in ensuring that third-party data recipients have adequate safeguards to protect sensitive financial data.
- **Exemptions and Fee Structures**: ICBA suggests exempting small depository institutions from creating developer interfaces, allowing banks to charge reasonable fees for access, and providing a whitelist of supervised third parties.
- **Data Retention and Compliance Timeframes**: Recommendations include reducing the transaction data retention period to 6 months and extending the compliance timeframe for community banks.
- **Standardized Format and Performance Criteria**: While supporting standardized data sharing formats, ICBA finds the proposed performance criteria, such as the 3.5-second response time, overly rigid and costly.
- **Screen Scraping and Security**: ICBA urges the CFPB to allow screen scraping as an alternative to developer interfaces and supports the proposed security program requirements.
- **Third-Party Data Security and Liability**: Concerns about the difficulty in vetting third-party data recipients and potential financial liabilities due to breaches. ICBA suggests financial liability should lie with the party where the breach occurs and proposes a Bureau-maintained whitelist of certified third-party data recipients.
- **Authorization and Data Access**: Support for provisions confirming third-party authorization and suggestions for further clarifications to ensure data providers can confirm consumer authorization.
- **Industry Standards for APIs**: Support for allowing industry standards for APIs to be established by recognized standard-setting bodies, with a recommendation to recognize the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) as a qualified organization.
- **Limitations on Data Use and Retention**: Support for proposed limitations on third-party data use, including prohibitions on selling data and targeted advertising without explicit consent, and agreement with proposed duration limits for data collection.
- **Data Accuracy and Security**: Agreement with the requirement for third parties to maintain policies ensuring data accuracy and security, emphasizing the need for Bureau supervision to ensure compliance.

**Key Suggestions:**
- Exempt small depository institutions from creating developer interfaces.
- Allow banks to charge reasonable fees for developer interface access.
- Provide a whitelist of supervised third parties.
- Reduce the required transaction data retention period to 6 months.
- Extend the compliance timeframe for community banks.
- Allow screen scraping as an alternative to developer interfaces.
- Specify that financial liability for breaches lies with the party where the breach occurs.
- Require third-party data recipients to indemnify data providers.
- Clarify the reasonable duration for data collection based on use cases.

# Profile Match : Having Fun with AOAI!

This was such a cool little project where we got to mess around with AOAI and do some pretty awesome stuff. Here’s the gist of what we did
- 🖼️ Turning Images into Stories: We took images that had some text and pictures of people, and pulled out all the interesting details about them. Each slide told us who they are, what they’re into, what they do for fun—basically their whole vibe. Then we asked GPT to do something fun: figure out which superhero they’d be and recommend them a food to try. (Because why not? 🦸‍♂️🍩)
- 🎨 Making New Images: Once we had all their info in a nice little JSON file, we used DALL-E 3 to whip up a brand-new image for each person. It’s like turning data into art—super fun to see how it all came out!
- 🤝 Finding Connections: After all that, we compared everyone’s profiles to find people who might click—shared interests, similar skills, or just an overall match. It felt kind of like playing matchmaker, but for hobbies and talents.

The whole point of this? To have a blast with AOAI, try out some new ideas, and learn how powerful (and fun!) this tool can be.

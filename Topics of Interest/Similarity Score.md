# Understanding Similarity Score

We took two different texts with various scenarios and generated cosine similaity score using both text-embedding-ada-002 and text-embedding-3-large. Here are our findings

## Findings
- text-embedding-ada-002 model’s cosine similarity score is between 0.68 to 1. text-embedding-3-large’s score is between 0-1. Very different as you see above. I like what I see with text-embedding-3-large. 
- Looks like the score is also dependent on the text domain. So same  type of text in two different domains will come with diff scores. 
- Using Top K along with score threshold will be helpful(Thanks Mary Wahl for this suggestion!!)
